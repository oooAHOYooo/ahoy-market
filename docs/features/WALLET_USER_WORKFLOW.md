---

## Workflow 1: Fund Wallet → Buy Merch with Wallet

### Step 1: User Funds Wallet

**Starting Point:** User is on `/account` page (Profile)

1. **User sees Wallet section:**
   - Current balance displayed (e.g., "$0.00")
   - Quick-pick buttons for common amounts
   - Custom amount input for wallet funding
   - "Add funds" button that uses the selected amount

2. **User picks an amount and clicks "Add funds":**
   - Frontend sends the selected amount from the profile page
   - Shows loading state: "Processing..."
   - POST request to `/payments/wallet/fund` with `{ amount: 5 }`

3. **Server creates Stripe Checkout Session:**
   - Validates user is logged in (401 if not)
   - Validates amount ($1.00 - $1000.00)
   - Creates Stripe Checkout Session
   - Returns `{ checkout_url: "https://checkout.stripe.com/...", session_id: "cs_..." }`

4. **User redirected to Stripe Checkout:**
   - **User enters credit card details on Stripe's secure page** (checkout.stripe.com)
   - Stripe processes payment
   - User completes payment on Stripe's PCI-compliant page

5. **Stripe webhook processes payment:**
   - Event: `checkout.session.completed`
   - Metadata: `type: "wallet_fund"`
   - Server adds funds to user's wallet balance
   - Creates `WalletTransaction` record (type: "fund")
   - User redirected to `/payments/wallet/success`

6. **User returns to account page:**
   - Wallet balance updated (e.g., "$5.00")
   - Transaction visible in "View transactions"

### Step 2: User Buys Merch with Wallet

**Starting Point:** User browses `/merch` page

1. **User selects merch item:**
   - Clicks "Buy" on a merch item
   - Redirected to `/checkout?type=merch&item_id=123&qty=1`

2. **Checkout page displays:**
   - Item details (name, quantity, price)
   - Total amount
   - **Wallet balance section** (if user is logged in):
     - Shows current wallet balance
     - If balance ≥ total: "Pay with wallet balance" checkbox enabled
     - If balance < total: "Insufficient balance" + "Fund Wallet" link

3. **User checks "Pay with wallet balance":**
   - Checkbox updates hidden field: `use_wallet = "true"`
   - User clicks "Complete Checkout" button

4. **Server processes wallet payment:**
   - POST to `/checkout/process` with `use_wallet=true`
   - Server validates CSRF token
   - Creates `Purchase` record (status: "pending")
   - Calls `deduct_wallet_balance()`:
     - Validates sufficient balance
     - Deducts amount from wallet
     - Creates `WalletTransaction` (type: "spend")
   - Marks `Purchase` as "paid"
   - Sets `Purchase.stripe_id = "wallet_{purchase_id}"`

5. **User redirected to success page:**
   - `/checkout/success?pid={purchase_id}`
   - Purchase complete (no Stripe redirect needed)
   - Wallet balance decreased

## Workflow 2: Buy Merch Directly with Stripe (No Wallet)

### Step 1: User Buys Merch Directly

**Starting Point:** User browses `/merch` page

1. **User selects merch item:**
   - Clicks "Buy" on a merch item
   - Redirected to `/checkout?type=merch&item_id=123&qty=1`

2. **Checkout page displays:**
   - Item details
   - Total amount
   - Wallet balance section (if logged in)
   - **User does NOT check "Pay with wallet balance"**

3. **User clicks "Complete Checkout":**
   - Form submits with `use_wallet=false` (default)
   - POST to `/checkout/process`

4. **Server creates Stripe Checkout Session:**
   - Validates CSRF token
   - Creates `Purchase` record (status: "pending")
   - Creates Stripe Checkout Session with:
     - Line items (merch item)
     - Metadata: `type: "merch"`, `purchase_id: "123"`
     - Success/cancel URLs
   - Returns redirect to Stripe Checkout URL

5. **User redirected to Stripe Checkout:**
   - **User enters credit card details on Stripe's secure page**
   - Completes payment on Stripe

6. **Stripe webhook processes payment:**
   - Event: `checkout.session.completed`
   - Metadata: `type: "merch"` (not "wallet_fund")
   - Server marks `Purchase` as "paid"
   - Sets `Purchase.stripe_id = checkout_session.id`
   - User redirected to `/checkout/success?pid={purchase_id}`

   - Creates `Tip` record:
     - `artist_id: "alex-figueroa"`
     - `amount: $10.00` (boost amount)
     - `artist_payout: $10.00` (100% of boost)
     - `stripe_fee: $0.00` (no Stripe fee for wallet)
     - `platform_fee: $0.75`
     - `total_paid: $11.34`
   - Updates user's portfolio position for artist
   - **Tip goes into "Alex Figueroa bucket"** (queryable by `artist_id`)
